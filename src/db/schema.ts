/**
 * Database Schema for Rowad Speedball Management Platform
 *
 * This file defines the PostgreSQL database schema using Drizzle ORM.
 * It includes all tables, relationships, constraints, and helper functions
 * for managing Speedball tournaments, players, events, and championships.
 *
 * **Key Features**:
 * - Multi-tenant organization support
 * - Federation and championship management
 * - Tournament bracket generation (single/double elimination)
 * - Player skill testing and assessment
 * - Training session attendance tracking
 * - Points-based ranking system
 *
 * **Naming Conventions**:
 * - Tables: plural snake_case (players, events, training_sessions)
 * - Columns: camelCase (dateOfBirth, organizationId)
 * - Enums: camelCase with 'Enum' suffix (noteTypeEnum, attendanceStatusEnum)
 * - Indexes: idx_tablename_column
 * - Unique constraints: unique_descriptor
 * - Check constraints: chk_descriptor
 *
 * @see /docs/table-core-guide.md for table system documentation

/**
 * User Table
 *
 * Central table for all authenticated users in the system.
 * Managed by better-auth with custom federation support.
 *
 * **Roles**:
 * - `super_admin`: System administrator (unrestricted access)
 * - `federation-admin`: Federation administrator (manages federation)
 * - `federation-editor`: Federation content editor (limited permissions)
 * - `owner`: Organization owner (full organization control)
 * - `admin`: Organization administrator (manages organization)
 * - `coach`: Coach (limited permissions)
 * - `player`: Player (read-only access)
 * - `member`: Basic member access
 *
 * **User Lifecycle**:
 * 1. User signs up via OAuth (Google) or email
 * 2. User is assigned to organizations via `member` table
 * 3. User can be linked to `players` or `coaches` via userId
 * 4. User's federation role is stored in `role` field
 * 5. Active organization stored in session
 *
 * **Important Notes**:
 * - Users can belong to multiple organizations (via `member` table)
 * - Users can have ONE federation role (federation-admin, federation-editor, or null)
 * - Organization roles are stored in `member.role` (owner, admin, coach, member)
 * - User deletion DOES NOT cascade delete players/coaches (set null instead)
 * - Banned users can't log in but data is preserved
 *
 * @see member - Organization memberships
 * @see players - Player profiles linked to users
 * @see coaches - Coach profiles linked to users

 * Organization Table
 *

 *
 * **Multi-tenancy Design**:
 * - Each organization is isolated (players, events, training sessions scoped to org)
 * - Users can be members of multiple organizations
 * - Active organization determined by session.activeOrganizationId
 * - Organizations can belong to a federation for inter-club competitions
 *
 * **Organization Lifecycle**:
 * 1. Organization created by user (becomes owner)
 * 2. Owner invites members via email (invitation table)
 * 3. Members accept invitation and join organization
 * 4. Organization can be linked to federation for championships
 *
 * **Important Notes**:
 * - Slug must be unique and URL-safe (used in routes)
 * - Deleting organization cascades to most related data (players, events, etc.)
 * - Federation link is optional (set null if federation removed)

 * - Organization context cached in better-auth cookie cache (1 minute)
 *
 * **Security Features**:
 * - IP address tracking for security monitoring
 * - User agent tracking for device identification

 * - Date of birth (used for age group calculation)
 * - Gender (male/female - affects event eligibility)
 * - Preferred hand (left/right/both - tracked for skill development)
 * - Team level (team_a/team_b/team_c - skill grouping within organization)
 *
 * **User Linking**:
 * - Players can be linked to user accounts via `userId` (optional)
 * - Linked players can access their profile and results
 * - One user can only be linked to ONE player (unique constraint)
 * - Player deletion sets userId to null (preserves user account)
 *
 * **Age Groups**:
 * - Calculated dynamically using `getAgeGroup(dateOfBirth)`
 * - Season-based (July-June): Age groups change mid-year
 * - Groups: mini, U-09, U-11, U-13, U-15, U-17, U-19, U-21, Seniors
 *
 * **Multi-tenancy**:
 * - Players belong to ONE organization
 * - Organization deletion sets organizationId to null (orphaned players)
 * - Players can be registered in federation via `federationPlayers` table
 *
 * **Important Notes**:
 * - Age is calculated dynamically (not stored)
 * - Team level is organization-specific (team_a in one org ≠ team_a in another)
 * - Players can participate in events matching their gender and age group
 * - Preferred hand used for position assignment in doubles/relay events

/**
 * Calculate a player's age using season-based logic
 *
 * **Season-Based Age Calculation**:
 * The sports season runs from July 1 to June 30 of the following year.
 * A player's age is determined by the year they turn that age during the current season.
 *
 * **Logic**:
 * - **July 1 - December 31** (months 7-12): New season starts
 *   → Age = currentYear - birthYear
 *   → Example: Born 2010, current date July 2024 → Age = 2024 - 2010 = 14
 *
 * - **January 1 - June 30** (months 1-6): Still in previous season
 *   → Age = currentYear - birthYear - 1
 *   → Example: Born 2010, current date March 2024 → Age = 2024 - 2010 - 1 = 13
 *
 * **Why This Matters**:
 * - Ensures fair competition by grouping players who turn the same age in the same season
 * - Prevents age advantage from birth month within a calendar year
 * - Aligns with how most youth sports leagues organize age groups
 *
 * **Examples**:
 * - Player born May 15, 2010:
 *   - On July 1, 2024: Age = 14 (new season, they will turn 14 this season)
 *   - On April 1, 2024: Age = 13 (previous season, they haven't turned 14 yet this season)
 *
 * - Player born October 20, 2010:
 *   - On July 1, 2024: Age = 14 (new season)
 *   - On November 1, 2024: Age = 14 (same season, already 14)
 *
 * @param dateOfBirth - Date of birth in 'yyyy-MM-dd' format
 * @returns Calculated age as integer

 * - **U-21**: Ages 20-21 (Under 21)
 * - **Seniors**: Ages 22+ (adult level)
 *
 * **Important Notes**:
 * - Age groups use the season-based age from calculateAge()
 * - "U-XX" means "Under XX" (player will be XX or younger during the season)

/**
 * Placement Tiers Table
 *
 * **Purpose**: Standardized placement categories that work across all event types.
 * Placement tiers group participants by their achievement level, regardless of
 * the event format (elimination, time-based, round-robin, etc.).
 *
 * **Tier Categories by Event Type**:
 *
 * **Elimination Events** (single-elimination, double-elimination):
 * - **WINNER** (rank: 1) - Champion of the event
 * - **FINALIST** (rank: 2) - Runner-up, lost in the final
 * - **THIRD_PLACE** (rank: 3) - Winner of 3rd place match (only if hasThirdPlaceMatch = true)
 * - **FOURTH_PLACE** (rank: 4) - Loser of 3rd place match (only if hasThirdPlaceMatch = true)
 * - **SF** (rank: 3-4) - Semi-final losers (when no 3rd place match exists)
 * - **QF** (rank: 5-8) - Quarter-final losers (4 players share this tier)
 * - **R16** (rank: 9-16) - Round of 16 losers (8 players share this tier)
 * - **R32** (rank: 17-32) - Round of 32 losers (16 players share this tier)
 *
 * **Time-Based Events** (format='tests' - super-solo, speed-solo, etc.):
 * - **POS_1** (rank: 1) - 1st place finisher
 * - **POS_2** (rank: 2) - 2nd place finisher
 * - **POS_3** (rank: 3) - 3rd place finisher
 * - **POS_N** (rank: N) - Nth place finisher (position-specific tiers)
 * Each position gets its own tier, allowing different points per position.
 *
 * **Important Notes**:
 * - Tiers are event-agnostic: same tier names work for all event formats
 * - Multiple players can share the same tier (e.g., 4 QF losers all get QF tier)
 * - The `rank` field indicates the general ranking order (1 = best, higher = lower rank)
 * - Tiers are used to look up points from Points Schema Entries
 * - Actual final position is stored in `eventResults.finalPosition` (can have duplicates)
 *
 * **Examples**:
 * - Elimination event: Winner gets WINNER tier, Runner-up gets FINALIST tier
 * - Time-based event: 1st place gets POS_1 tier, 2nd place gets POS_2 tier
 * - QF losers: All 4 players get QF tier, but may have different finalPosition values
 *
 * @see eventResults - Where tiers are assigned to participants
 * @see pointsSchemaEntry - Maps tiers to points values

/**
 * Points Schemas Table
 *
 * **Purpose**: Named point systems that define how points are awarded for different
 * placement tiers. A points schema is a collection of point rules that can be
 * reused across multiple events (e.g., "National Championship 2024 Points System").
 *
 * **How It Works**:
 * - A points schema is a container/grouping mechanism
 * - It contains multiple Points Schema Entries that map placement tiers to point values
 * - Events reference a points schema via `events.pointsSchemaId`
 * - Different schemas can award different points for the same tier
 *
 * **Use Cases**:
 * - **Championship Events**: Use a championship-specific schema with higher point values
 * - **Regular Events**: Use a standard schema with lower point values
 * - **Time-Based Events**: Use a schema with position-specific tiers (POS_1, POS_2, etc.)
 * - **Elimination Events**: Use a schema with match-based tiers (WINNER, FINALIST, QF, etc.)
 *
 * **Examples**:
 * - "National Championship 2024" - High-value points for championship events
 * - "Regional League 2024" - Standard points for regular competitions
 * - "Time-Based Standard" - Points for time-based events (POS_1 = 100, POS_2 = 80, etc.)
 *
 * **Important Notes**:
 * - Schemas are metadata only (name, description)
 * - Actual point values are defined in Points Schema Entries
 * - One schema can be used by multiple events
 * - Changing a schema affects all events using it (points are looked up dynamically)
 *
 * @see pointsSchemaEntry - Contains the actual tier-to-points mappings
 * @see events.pointsSchemaId - Links events to their point system

/**
 * Points Schema Entries Table
 *
 * **Purpose**: Maps placement tiers to point values within a specific points schema.
 * This is the junction table that connects Points Schemas to Placement Tiers and
 * defines how many points each tier awards.
 *
 * **How It Works**:
 * - Each entry links one placement tier to one points schema
 * - Defines the points awarded for that tier in that schema
 * - Multiple schemas can have different point values for the same tier
 * - When an event completes, points are looked up from the event's schema entries
 *
 * **Point Calculation Flow**:
 * 1. Event completes → Each participant gets assigned a `placementTierId`
 * 2. Look up event's `pointsSchemaId` from `events.pointsSchemaId`
 * 3. Find matching `pointsSchemaEntry` for (schemaId, tierId)
 * 4. Use the `points` value from that entry
 * 5. Store in `eventResults.pointsAwarded`
 *
 * **Examples**:
 *
 * **Elimination Event Schema**:
 * - WINNER → 100 points
 * - FINALIST → 75 points
 * - THIRD_PLACE → 50 points
 * - FOURTH_PLACE → 40 points
 * - SF → 30 points
 * - QF → 20 points
 *
 * **Time-Based Event Schema**:
 * - POS_1 → 100 points
 * - POS_2 → 80 points
 * - POS_3 → 60 points
 * - POS_4 → 50 points
 * - POS_5 → 40 points
 * - ... (position-specific points)
 *
 * **Important Notes**:
 * - Schema entries are "dumb and stable" - they don't care about event format
 * - Same tier can have different points in different schemas
 * - Points are looked up dynamically when events complete
 * - One tier can only appear once per schema (unique constraint)
 * - If a tier is missing from a schema, it defaults to 0 points
 *
 * **Why Separate from Placement Tiers**:
 * - Allows different point systems for the same tier
 * - Championship events can award more points than regular events
 * - Points can be updated without changing tier definitions
 * - Supports multiple concurrent point systems
 *
 * @see placementTiers - The tiers being mapped
 * @see pointsSchemas - The schema containing this entry
 * @see eventResults - Where calculated points are stored

/**
 * Event Results Table
 *
 * **Purpose**: Stores the final ranking and points for each participant in an event.
 * This table represents the outcome of an event, not the match-by-match history.
 * Every participant gets exactly one result record when the event completes.
 *
 * **Ranking System Overview**:
 *
 * The ranking system uses two complementary fields:
 * - **`finalPosition`**: Exact numerical rank (1, 2, 3, 4, 5...)
 * - **`placementTierId`**: Grouping tier for points calculation (WINNER, FINALIST, QF, etc.)
 *
 * **Key Design Principles**:
 * 1. **`finalPosition` is NOT unique** - Multiple players can share the same position
 *    (e.g., 4 QF losers all at position 5)
 * 2. **`placementTierId` groups players** - All players in same tier get same points
 * 3. **Tiers vary by event type** - Elimination uses match-based tiers, time-based uses position tiers
 *
 * **Handling Different Event Types**:
 *
 * **Elimination Events** (single-elimination, double-elimination):
 * - Winner: `finalPosition = 1`, `placementTierId = WINNER`
 * - Runner-up: `finalPosition = 2`, `placementTierId = FINALIST`
 * - 3rd place match winner: `finalPosition = 3`, `placementTierId = THIRD_PLACE`
 * - 3rd place match loser: `finalPosition = 4`, `placementTierId = FOURTH_PLACE`
 * - QF losers (no 3rd place match): `finalPosition = 5`, `placementTierId = QF` (all 4 players)
 * - SF losers (no 3rd place match): `finalPosition = 3 or 4`, `placementTierId = SF`
 *
 * **Time-Based Events** (format='tests' - super-solo, speed-solo, etc.):
 * - 1st place: `finalPosition = 1`, `placementTierId = POS_1`
 * - 2nd place: `finalPosition = 2`, `placementTierId = POS_2`
 * - 3rd place: `finalPosition = 3`, `placementTierId = POS_3`
 * - Each position gets its own tier (position-specific points)
 * - Every participant has a unique finalPosition (no duplicates in time-based events)
 *
 * **Multiple Players at Same Position**:
 *
 * When multiple players share the same `finalPosition` (common in elimination events):
 * - All players get the same `placementTierId` (e.g., all QF losers get QF tier)
 * - All players get the same `pointsAwarded` (from the tier's points schema entry)
 * - Display order can be determined by other criteria (name, registration order, etc.)
 *
 * **Example: 4 QF Losers**:
 * ```
 * Player A: finalPosition = 5, placementTierId = QF, pointsAwarded = 20
 * Player B: finalPosition = 5, placementTierId = QF, pointsAwarded = 20
 * Player C: finalPosition = 5, placementTierId = QF, pointsAwarded = 20
 * Player D: finalPosition = 5, placementTierId = QF, pointsAwarded = 20
 * ```
 * All four players share position 5, tier QF, and receive the same points.
 *
 * **Points Calculation**:
 *
 * When an event completes:
 * 1. Each participant is assigned a `placementTierId` based on their result
 * 2. System looks up the event's `pointsSchemaId` from `events.pointsSchemaId`
 * 3. Finds the `pointsSchemaEntry` matching (schemaId, tierId)
 * 4. Sets `pointsAwarded` to the entry's `points` value
 * 5. Points are stored here (denormalized for performance and historical accuracy)
 *
 * **Important Notes**:
 * - One result per registration per event (unique constraint)
 * - `finalPosition` can be NULL (rare, but possible for incomplete events)
 * - `placementTierId` is required (everyone must have a tier)
 * - `pointsAwarded` is stored here (denormalized) for performance and historical accuracy
 * - Points are calculated once when event completes, then stored
 * - Changing points schema doesn't retroactively update stored points
 *
 * **Querying Rankings**:
 *
 * To get event rankings:
 * ```sql
 * SELECT * FROM event_results
 * WHERE event_id = ?
 * ORDER BY final_position ASC NULLS LAST
 * ```
 * Note: When multiple players share the same finalPosition, you can add additional
 * sorting criteria (e.g., player name, registration order) for consistent display.
 *
 * To get player's total points across all events:
 * ```sql
 * SELECT SUM(points_awarded) FROM event_results
 * WHERE registration_id IN (SELECT id FROM registrations WHERE player_id = ?)
 * ```

 * @see pointsSchemas - The point system used by the event
