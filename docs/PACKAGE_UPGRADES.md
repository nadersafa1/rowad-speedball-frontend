- Better type inference
- Improved error messages with `z.treeifyError()`
- Breaking changes handled in migration

### Next.js 15.x
- Latest stable version
- Better performance
- Improved App Router
- Better React 19 support
- Enhanced server components

### React 19.x
- Latest stable release
- Performance improvements
- New hooks and features
- Better TypeScript support
- Required by Next.js 15.x

### Drizzle ORM

- Better than raw SQL queries
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Schema-first approach
- Migration tools included

### Better Auth 1.3.29
- Latest security patches
- Bug fixes
- Better Next.js integration
- Improved email verification flow

## Compatibility Notes

### React 19 Warnings
You may see peer dependency warnings about some packages still expecting React 18. This is normal during the transition period. These packages will work fine with React 19 as they're backward compatible.

### Next.js 15 Changes
- App Router is now stable and recommended
- Server components are the default
- Better error handling
- Improved middleware support

## Breaking Changes

### Zod 3.x → 4.x
- `.parse()` return types are stricter
- Error shapes have changed (using `z.treeifyError()` for consistency)
- Some refinement behaviors are different

### Next.js 14 → 15
- Some middleware APIs have changed
- Image optimization defaults changed
- Font optimization improved

### React 18 → 19
- Automatic batching improvements
- useId hook changes
- Concurrent features are more stable

## Migration Safety

All breaking changes have been handled in the migration:
- ✅ Zod schemas updated to 4.x syntax
- ✅ Next.js API routes use latest conventions
- ✅ React components use latest patterns
- ✅ Type definitions updated

## Testing Recommendations

After these upgrades, test:
1. ✅ Build process: `npm run build`
2. ✅ Development server: `npm run dev`
3. ✅ Type checking: `npm run type-check`
4. ✅ Linting: `npm run lint`
5. ✅ Database operations: `npm run db:push`

## Performance Impact

Expected improvements:
- **Build time**: Faster with Next.js 15
- **Runtime**: Better with React 19 optimizations
- **Type checking**: Faster with TypeScript 5.9
- **Database queries**: More efficient with Drizzle ORM

## Security Updates

- ✅ All packages updated to latest security patches
- ✅ Better Auth includes latest security fixes
- ✅ Next.js 15 includes security improvements
- ✅ Dependencies audited (4 moderate vulnerabilities remain, can be fixed with `npm audit fix`)

## Next Steps

1. Review and test all functionality
2. Run `npm audit fix` to address remaining vulnerabilities
3. Update any custom code that might be affected
4. Test authentication flows thoroughly
5. Test database operations
6. Deploy to staging for integration testing
